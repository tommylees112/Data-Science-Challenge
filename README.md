# Data-Science-Challenge
OS Data Science Club Challenge 

Here you will find the code that I have been working on as part of the DSC Challenge, set up in OS to extend and share our Data Science skills.

The mission statement and values of the DSC Challenge can be found below:

## *We will explore Data Science tools and technologies to progress our shared knowledge and drive innovation with data in OS.*

### Adventurous
We will foster an open culture that encourages creative problem solving.
We will work together to explore the methods of data science, and share our learnings widely.

### Incisive
We will seek to absorb complexity and transmit clarity.
We will be healthily sceptical of data and approaches taken to explore the data.

### Restless
We will proactively seek failure, pushing data to provide us with new insights.
We will explore data iteratively, moving fast and breaking things. 
We aim to light a fire of imagination, not to fill a bucket of knowledge.
We will question all assumptions, trying to justify all decisions that we made.

### True
We will not give false impressions about our models and their accuracy. Instead, we will make explicit the assumptions and oversights.
We will operate with integrity and work to the values set out in this mission statement.
